# Discord Minecraft Whitelist

## What?
This project allows Minecraft users to be whitelisted via a /whitelist command in a discord channel.
It queries PlayerDB for the UUID and adds it to the whitelist file, then reloads said whitelist via RCON.

## Why?
On older server versions, whitelisting is sometimes borked.
